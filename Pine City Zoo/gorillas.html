         <h3>GORILLAS</h3>
         <p>Gorillas are the largest living primates, with adult males reaching heights of 1.4 to 1.8 meters (4.6 to 5.9 feet) and weighing between 136 to 227 kilograms (300 to 500 pounds). Females are generally smaller, with heights ranging from 1.25 to 1.5 meters (4.1 to 4.9 feet). They have thick, dark fur and a distinctive physical appearance, with broad chests and shoulders. Gorillas are herbivores, primarily eating roots, leaves, stems, and other vegetation.
</p>
<p>Gorillas inhabit equatorial Africa, with two main species: the eastern gorilla and the western gorilla. Western lowland gorillas are found in Central West African countries, while eastern lowland gorillas are found in the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda. They live in troops, led by a dominant silverback male, and have a complex social structure. Gorillas are known for their intelligence and have been observed using tools and exhibiting complex behaviors.
</p>
<p>Unfortunately, gorillas are threatened by habitat destruction and poaching. The western gorilla population is estimated to be around 316,000 in the wild, while the eastern gorilla population is critically endangered, with fewer than 5,000 individuals remaining in the wild. Mountain gorillas, a subspecies of eastern gorillas, are particularly endangered, with only around 880 individuals remaining in the wild. Conservation efforts are underway to protect gorilla populations and habitats, but more work is needed to ensure the long-term survival of these magnificent animals.
</p>
<p>Gorillas are closely related to humans, with DNA similarities ranging from 96 to 99%. This close genetic relationship makes them an important subject for scientific study, particularly in the fields of genetics, behavior, and conservation. By studying gorillas, researchers can gain insights into human evolution, behavior, and health, as well as develop strategies for protecting these incredible animals and their habitats.</p>
 <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
         <p>You will find the gorillas cage at GO12.</p>
