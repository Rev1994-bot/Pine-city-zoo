         <h3>GIRAFFES</h3>
         <p>Giraffes are the tallest living terrestrial animals, with males reaching heights of 4.3-5.7 meters (14.1-18.7 feet) and females reaching slightly lower heights. They have distinctive physical features, including long necks and legs, as well as horn-like structures called ossicones on their heads. Their coats are unique, featuring spotted patterns that can vary greatly between individuals, while their skin is typically gray or tan. In terms of weight, adult males can weigh around 1,192 kilograms (2,628 pounds), with females weighing about 828 kilograms (1,826 pounds).
</p>
            <p>Giraffes are primarily found in the savannas and open woodlands of sub-Saharan Africa, where they inhabit regions with abundant acacia trees and other vegetation. They are herbivorous, feeding mainly on leaves, flowers, and fruits from tall trees, which they can reach with their long necks. Giraffes are known for their unique social structure, often forming loose herds that can vary in size and composition.</p>
        
            <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
            <p>You will find the giraffes at G15, just beyond the research center.</p>
