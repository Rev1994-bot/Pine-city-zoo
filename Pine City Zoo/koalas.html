         <h3>KAOLAS</h3>
            <p>Koalas are iconic marsupials native to Australia, known for their distinctive appearance and behavior. They have a stout, tailless body covered in thick, gray fur, large round ears, and a flat, black nose. Adult koalas typically weigh between 4 to 14 kilograms (9 to 31 pounds) and measure about 60 to 85 centimeters (24 to 33 inches) in length. Their diet consists almost exclusively of eucalyptus leaves, which they consume in large quantities due to their low nutritional value.</p>
            
                <p>Koalas are primarily found in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia, including Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia. They are arboreal animals, spending most of their lives in trees where they sleep for up to 20 hours a day. Koalas are solitary creatures, with each individual having its own home range that overlaps with others.</p>
            
                <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
                <p>You will find the koalas next to the giraffe enclosure.</p>
