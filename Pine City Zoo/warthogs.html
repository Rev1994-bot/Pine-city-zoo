         <h3>WARTHOGS</h3>
          <p>Warthogs are wild pigs native to Africa, known for their distinctive appearance and behavior. They have a stocky build, long legs, and a large head with prominent tusks that can grow up to 25 centimeters (10 inches) in length. Their skin is covered in coarse, bristly hair, and they have a sparse mane along their backs. Adult warthogs typically weigh between 50 to 150 kilograms (110 to 330 pounds) and measure about 90 to 150 centimeters (35 to 59 inches) in length.</p>  
<p>Warthogs are primarily found in savannas, grasslands, and open woodlands across sub-Saharan Africa. They are well-adapted to their environment, with long legs that allow them to run quickly and a keen sense of smell to locate food. Warthogs are omnivorous, feeding on a diet of grasses, roots, fruits, and occasionally small animals or carrion. They are known for their unique behavior of kneeling on their front knees while feeding, which helps them reach vegetation close to the ground.</p>
<p>Warthogs are social animals and often live in small groups called sounders. 
     <p><strong>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</strong></p>
     <p>You will find the warthogs at WA11, near the elephant enclosure.</p>
