         <h3>PANDAS</h3>
            <p>Pandas, also known as giant pandas, are large bears native to China. They are easily recognized by their distinctive black and white fur, with black patches around their eyes, ears, and on their limbs. Adult pandas typically weigh between 70 to 160 kilograms (154 to 352 pounds) and measure about 1.2 to 1.8 meters (4 to 6 feet) in length. Pandas are primarily herbivores, with bamboo making up about 99% of their diet.</p>
            <p>Pandas are found in the mountainous regions of central China, particularly in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces. They inhabit dense bamboo forests at elevations ranging from 1,200 to 3,400 meters (4,000 to 11,000 feet). Pandas are solitary animals, with each individual having its own home range. They are known for their playful behavior and can often be seen climbing trees or rolling around on the ground.</p>
<p>Pandas are classified as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), with an estimated population of around 1,864 individuals in the wild. Their primary threats include habitat loss due to deforestation and human encroachment, as well as climate change affecting bamboo availability. Conservation efforts have been implemented to protect panda habitats and increase their population, including the establishment of nature reserves and breeding programs.</p>
<p>Pandas are also culturally significant in China, symbolizing peace and friendship. They are often used as ambassadors for wildlife conservation and have become a global icon for endangered species. The Chinese government has made significant efforts to protect pandas, including the establishment of the Wolong National Nature Reserve and the Sichuan Giant Panda Breeding Research Base, which focus on panda conservation and research.</p>
