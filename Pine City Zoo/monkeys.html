         <h3>MONKEYS</h3>
<P>Monkeys are primates that belong to the order Simiiformes, which also includes apes. There are over 260 species of monkeys, ranging in size, shape, and behavior. Monkeys are found in various parts of the world, including tropical forests, savannas, and mountainous regions. They are known for their agility, intelligence, and social behavior.
</P>
<P>One of the most distinctive features of monkeys is their prehensile tails, which many species use to grasp and climb. Monkeys are also known for their advanced cognitive abilities, including problem-solving, memory, and learning. Some species of monkeys have been observed using tools, such as rocks and sticks, to gather food or navigate their environment.

<p>Monkeys are social animals and often live in large groups, called troops. These troops are typically led by a dominant male and are characterized by complex social dynamics. Monkeys communicate with each other using a variety of vocalizations, including calls, screams, and chirps. They also use body language and facial expressions to convey information and emotions.
</p>
<p>Monkeys are omnivores and feed on a variety of foods, including fruits, leaves, seeds, and insects. Some species of monkeys are specialized to eat specific foods, such as figs or bamboo. Monkeys play an important role in their ecosystems, helping to disperse seeds and maintain the balance of nature. Unfortunately, many monkey species are threatened by habitat loss, hunting, and disease, highlighting the need for conservation efforts to protect these fascinating animals.</p>
