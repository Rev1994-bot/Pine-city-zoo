They are crepuscular, meaning they are most active during the early morning and late afternoon, and can run at speeds of up to 60 kilometers per hour (37 miles per hour).

<p>Gemsboks are listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and their populations are considered stable in many areas. However, they still face threats from habitat degradation and hunting. In some regions, gemsboks have been introduced as part of conservation efforts or for hunting purposes.
